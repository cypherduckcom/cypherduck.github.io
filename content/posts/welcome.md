Hello reader, welcome to the resistance!

We're living in a world where your smart doorbell is probably gossiping about your package deliveries to Amazon, your email provider is training AI models on your love letters, and somehow your grocery store loyalty card knows you're lactose intolerant before your doctor does. Your data's being harvested faster than a Bitcoin mining farm burns through electricity, and quite frankly, that's just not okay.

That's where Cypherduck comes in.

Look, I've heard the saying "if you're not paying, you're the product" approximately 847 times, but I feel like "if you're not self-hosting, you're just renting your digital life" is more fitting for 2025. This isn't another blog telling you to "just use a VPN" and call it a day (though honestly, you probably should). We're here to dive deep into the tools, techniques, and spectacular failures that actually give you control over your digital existence.

Whether you're a crypto enthusiast trying to navigate the latest privacy coins without getting rugpulled, a self-hosting newbie wondering if you can really ditch Google Photos without losing your sanity, or someone who just wants to understand why everyone's suddenly talking about zero-knowledge proofs – we've got you covered.

We believe privacy shouldn't require a computer science degree or the patience of a saint (though both help). Sure, some of this stuff gets technical – we're not going to pretend that spinning up your own Matrix server is as easy as making toast – but we'll break it down without talking down to you.

Your data is yours. Your communications should be private. And yes, you absolutely can host your own Netflix-style streaming server without losing your mind or your marriage.

Plus, I trust my own hardware more than I trust Mark Zuckerberg with literally anything.

Ready to reclaim your digital sovereignty? Let's get started.
