Welcome to Cypherduck

Digital privacy is disappearing. Companies harvest your data for profit. Governments expand surveillance programs. Your personal information gets sold to the highest bidder.

Most people accept this as inevitable. It's not.

Cypherduck covers practical privacy and security solutions. We focus on tools you can actually use: encryption software, self-hosted services, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, and network security setups.

No theoretical discussions. No corporate privacy policies to parse. Just working solutions with clear implementation guides.

Topics include:
- Email and messaging encryption
- Self-hosting your own services
- Cryptocurrency privacy techniques
- Network-wide ad and tracker blocking
- Secure operating systems and hardware

Privacy requires effort. The tools exist and they work. Most people just don't know they're available or how to use them.

That changes here.

Take back control of your digital life.
